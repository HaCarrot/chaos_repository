        A bunny that has found 
        itself a new job in the metro. 
        It lacks any intelligence to 
        comprehend basic concepts, let 
        alone operate a train. 

        Despite that, it is able to somehow 
        call a train when it whistles.

        The small hat on it is cute though...

## Self
lotte-talk-self1:
      text: \n<LOTTE>I used to run a \c[3]COFFEE\c[0] shop around here, but the beans have become far too difficult to come by these days...

lotte-talk-self2:
      text: \n<LOTTE>I've started selling \c[3]TEA\c[0] products instead...\. Just as much warmth, and half as much caffeine! 

lotte-talk-self3:
      text: \n<LOTTE>I sold the last cup of \c[3]COFFEE\c[0] to the girl who has a TV for a head...\! She paid quite the pretty penny for it, too.

lotte-talk-self4:
      text: \n<LOTTE>I've seen people who need their morning \c[3]COFFEE\c[0], but I think she takes it to another level!\! I wonder what sort of side hustle she has to be able to even afford that much...
#Products
lotte-talk-prod1:
      text: \n<LOTTE>I mostly sell different types of \c[3]TEA\c[0]. Every blend is unique!

lotte-talk-prod2:
      text: \n<LOTTE>I'm always experimenting with new blends and ingredients,\. so come back here from time to time to ensure you're the first one to try my latest products!

##about TV Girl before LJG
lotte-talk-tvg1-1:
      text: \n<LOTTE>Oh, her?. She just really wants \c[3]COFFEE\c[0] for some reason.

lotte-talk-tvg1-2:
      text: \n<LOTTE>Thinking about it,. how do you drink with a TV head anyways?

##about TV Girl
lotte-talk-tvg2-1:
      text: \n<LOTTE>The TV-headed girl just stormed off to the \c[11]bottom entrance\c[0].\! The way she was acting, you'd think she was suffering from withdrawals or something...

lotte-talk-tvg2-2:
      text: \n<LOTTE>The way she was like sobbing over the counter for a while, slamming it, and shaking like a massage chair...\. Strange girl.

##about TV Girl 2 - After TV Girl
lotte-talk-tvga1:
      text: \n<LOTTE>Oh, you dealt with her?\. And she didn't bite your head off?

lotte-talk-tvga2:
      text: \n<LOTTE>Well,\. at least she'll be too tuckered out to give me any more grief!

lotte-talk-tvga3:
      text: \n<LOTTE>Here, take this -\. it's the least I can do!
